/// This example shows 3 things with Auto Layout.
///
/// 1. How to make a `UITextView` that resizes itself by its content.
/// 2. How to use `UIStackView` to place views top to bottom.
/// 3. How to make `UIScrollView.contentSize` automatically track its content size.
///
/// First, #1 is easy. `UITextView` is a `UIScrollView`, and `UIScrollView` just behaves like plain
/// `UIView` if `scrollEnabled` is set to `false`.
/// This solution is described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21287306/246776).
///
/// To make `UIStackView` to work, you have to use Auto Layout for all related views.
/// `UIStackView` resizes itself automatically to fit to its content views.
/// So, just pin its left, right, top to make view to flow top to bottom.
///
/// Anyway, this is a bit different in a `UIScrollView`. Because scroll-view behaves differently
/// with Auto Layout, and you actually have to pin all four sides to make stack-view to work
/// as expected. `UIScrollView` seems have low priority, so it actually shrinks its internal
/// something to shrink to its content if its content if pinned to all four sides.
/// So, if need to pin all four sides to make scroll-view content-size to be adjusted automatically
/// to its contained stack-view. Then, stack-view will resize itself to its contents.
/// This behavior is explained [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2154/_index.html).
///
/// * Note that `UIStackView` doesn't perform any drawing, so it cannot have background-color.
///
